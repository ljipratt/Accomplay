Acoompaniment Application
Libraries: Music21

User iput:
- Root Note(String)
- Major/Minor
- BPM(Float/Int)

Generate:
- Chord(Note Array)
- ChordScale
    -Composed of only notes from the first, third, fifth, and seventh notes of the scale
- sooo theres a ton of variables, will make a map of them all soon.
TODO:

Separate Classes lololololololol

Add Time signature
- tonic low octave hits on every downbeat(for pattern 1)

Add more Accompaniment Patterns
-look into inversions if needed
—accompaniment pattern 1:
- One octave down from the tonic, one octave up from tonic, hits every note on the chordscale up and down arpeggiated
- Tonic hits a double octave in the baseline on every four beats
-Possibly a metronome


Make sure the scales can work for diminished, augmented, etc.

-add function for multiple chordsssss
-add function for how long the chord stays arpeggiating dependent
on the time signature, tempo, and how many chords are needed per measure
-possibly important to play chord blocks if there is not enough time
to play every arpeggiation
