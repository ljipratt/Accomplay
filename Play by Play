Acoompaniment Application
Libraries: Music21

User input:
- Root Note(String)
- Major/Minor
- BPM(Float/Int)

Generate:
- Chord(Note Array)
- ChordScale
    -Composed of only notes from the first, third, fifth, and seventh notes of the scale
- sooo theres a ton of variables, will make a map of them all soon.


General Ideas to be fleshed out:

GUI
- Sheet Music Display
    - White Background
    - Stalves
    - Generate number of measures based on user input
    - A Timeline Scrubber
- Keyboard Display
- Chord Input Display






Variables to add:






BeatIndex
-FirstBeat(number)
-LastBeat(number)
-BeatDuration(number)

MusicSheet
-list of measures

Measures:
-list of notes
-returns measure number

getTime
- describes what beat we are on
describes what measure we are on
-
-increments every

- all Chords need to have a beatIndex Range
-->Describes coordinates for music location
-->Measures also have beat duration




====Patterns & Seeds====
Drumbeat Preset
-which beats the bass drum hits on
-which beats the snares hits on
-which beats the high hat hits on

Bass line Preset
-which beats to play the tonic on
-walking bass? gotta learn how that works


TODO:


-Fix Metronome
    -loud ass whistle sound
    -Also output is broken for chords, I think




- tonic low octave hits on every downbeat(for pattern 1)

===Add more Accompaniment Patterns===

Define Bassline Patterns
- Walking bass, tonic octave hits, etc

Bassline Pattern 1:
- Tonic hits a double octave in the baseline on every four beats

------------------------
Backing Chord Pattern 1:
- Hits every note on the chordscale up and down arpeggiated

-------------------------
Backing Chord Pattern 2:
- Block chords





===============================

Make sure the scales can work for diminished, augmented, etc.
-possibly important to play chord blocks if there is not enough time
to play every arpeggiation


NOTES ON CONFIG:
Python v3.11
Music21 v9.10

pip install music21
MIDI Configuration 
- setup FluidSynth
    - requires soundfonts and shit that may need to be loaded by the user in the environment
    -for now just generates midi files
